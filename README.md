# Data Pipeline for Google Chat Spaces

**Project Duration:** July 2022 to Present (Full Time)

## Description

Developed a Python-based data pipeline to extract data from chat spaces, including messages, attachments, member details, etc., The data pipeline aims to streamline the process of collecting and analyzing data from Google Chat spaces to derive insights and patterns for informed decision-making.

## Key Features

- Developed a Python tool to extract data from chat spaces and store it in Google Sheets and Snowflake DB for future analysis.
- Analyzed the collected data using Python and relevant libraries to derive insights and patterns.
- Created a dynamic dashboard to visualize key metrics and insights for informed decision-making.
- Integrated the data pipeline with a scheduling system to run it on a regular basis, ensuring up-to-date data analysis.
- Worked collaboratively with the team to ensure efficient data management and analysis processes.
- Utilized Python, Pygsheets, Sheets API, Chat API, People API, and SQL for seamless data management and analysis.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pygsheets
- Google Sheets API
- Google Chat API
- Google People API
- Snowflake DB
- SQL

## How It Works

1. The Python tool extracts data from chat spaces, including messages, attachments, and member details, using the Google Chat API and People API.
2. The extracted data is stored in Google Sheets and Snowflake DB for future analysis.
3. Python scripts analyze the collected data to derive insights and patterns using relevant libraries.
4. A dynamic dashboard is created using Python visualization libraries to visualize key metrics and insights for informed decision-making.
5. The data pipeline is integrated with a scheduling system to run it on a regular basis, ensuring up-to-date data analysis.

## Benefits

- Streamlines the process of collecting and analyzing data from Google Chat spaces.
- Provides insights and patterns for informed decision-making.
- Facilitates collaboration and efficiency in data management and analysis processes.
- Ensures up-to-date data analysis through integration with a scheduling system.

## Usage

The data pipeline is used to extract data from Google Chat spaces, store it in Google Sheets and Snowflake DB, analyze the collected data, and visualize key metrics and insights using the dynamic dashboard.
